# NText
Text editor web-application made in JavaScript
	Ideally this will allow local saving & saving to the server, custom syntax highlighting and heuristical automatic indentation (no indentation characters necessary).
	
	Comes from a desire to have a good text editor to use from anywhere, available for use by everyone.
